It displays what my name is, that's all it does

I don't know how to install it, but if you're able to, you just write "node index.js" in the terminal to use it

In terms of adding ESLint to the project, I simply followed the steps outlined by my teacher

1. Made sure my project had all the necessary files (package.json) and that I could open a terminal in gitbash
2. Installed ESLint with a simple command in the gitbash terminal
3. Initialized it with another command and made sure to verify the set-up was correct.
4. Configured the config file generated in the initiailization
5. Added a lint script to the package.json file
6. From there, just ran it to make sure it all worked.
